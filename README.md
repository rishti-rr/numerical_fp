# Core Functionalities
1.	User Input: Accepts the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input.
2.	Calculation: Computes optimized investment returns using the False Position Method.
3.	Visualization: Dynamically displays results and graphs using Plotly.js.
4.	Responsiveness: Ensures compatibility with desktop and mobile devices.
________________________________________
# Implementation
The project was implemented using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS with Plotly.js for the frontend.
The key logic of the application is demonstrated by the following code snippet:
python
Copy code
def calculate_investment(principal, rate, time):
    # Compound interest calculation
    final_amount = principal * (1 + rate) ** time
    return final_amount
